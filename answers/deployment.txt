EC2 Flask App Deployment Plan

Spin Up the EC2 Instance:
First, I’ll create an EC2 instance with Docker already installed. I’ll pick an appropriate instance type and set up SSH access so I can get into it easily.

Get the Flask App to EC2:

Option 1: I’ll SCP the app files, including the Dockerfile, over to the EC2 instance.
Option 2: If I’ve already pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub (or ECR), I’ll just pull it onto the EC2 instance.
Build the Docker Image (If I’m Transferring Files):
If I’m using files, I’ll SSH into the EC2 instance, navigate to the folder where the Dockerfile is, and run the docker build command to create the image for my Flask app.

Start the Docker Container:
I’ll run the container in detached mode and make sure to map the app's ports (usually 80) to the host so it’s accessible externally.

Set Up EC2 Security Group:
I’ll go to the EC2 console, find the security group for my instance, and add an inbound rule to allow traffic on port 80 (or whatever port I’m using).

Check the Flask App:
Once the container’s running, I’ll open up a browser and test the public IP of my EC2 instance to make sure the Flask app is working.

Set Up Auto-Restart for the Container (Optional):
If I want my app to come back up automatically after a reboot, I’ll configure the container to restart when the EC2 instance does.

Reverse Proxy with Nginx (Optional for Production):
If it’s a production setup, I’ll install Nginx on EC2, configure it to forward traffic to the Flask app container, and make sure everything’s secure and optimized.

Monitor & Troubleshoot:
I’ll check the container logs and inspect the running containers to troubleshoot any issues and make sure everything is running smoothly.
