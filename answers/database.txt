Weather Data Table:
    This table stores daily weather records for different weather stations. 
    Each entry includes a station ID, date, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation levels.

    To prevent duplicate records for the same station on the same day, a UNIQUE constraint is applied to the (station_id, date) combination. 
    If data is missing, it can either be left as NULL or replaced with a placeholder value (like -9999 for missing temperature readings).

Weather Statistics Table:
    Instead of calculating yearly weather stats every time a query runs, this table pre computes and stores yearly summaries for each station. 
    This makes queries more efficient and reduces unnecessary recalculations.

    It contains key statistical values like average max temperature, average min temperature, and total precipitation for a given year. 
    To ensure each station has only one summary per year, a UNIQUE constraint is set on (station_id, year).


Query Used To Create Tables:
CREATE TABLE weather_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Auto-incrementing unique identifier for each record
    station_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Identifier for the weather station
    date DATE NOT NULL,  -- The recorded date for weather data
    max_temp INT,  -- Recorded maximum temperature (tenths of a degree Celsius)
    min_temp INT,  -- Recorded minimum temperature (tenths of a degree Celsius)
    precipitation INT,  -- Total precipitation recorded (tenths of a millimeter)
    UNIQUE(station_id, date)  -- Ensures no duplicate records for the same station and date
);

CREATE TABLE weather_stats (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique ID for each yearly summary record
    station_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Weather station associated with the summary
    year INT NOT NULL,  -- The year for which statistics are computed
    avg_max_temp FLOAT,  -- Mean of maximum daily temperatures (Celsius)
    avg_min_temp FLOAT,  -- Mean of minimum daily temperatures (Celsius)
    total_precipitation FLOAT,  -- Sum of all precipitation over the year (centimeters)
    UNIQUE(station_id, year)  -- Ensures one summary per station per year
);
